Some examples read like a guide or synopsis of the lesson, some of them are first and foremost a reflection about agile principles that are supported by a classroom activity or unit.\nAuthors: Paul Magnuson, Nicola Cosgrove\nIntroduction  We’ve been talking about and experimenting with agile in education since 2014-2015. In Summer 2016 we wrote the first sample lesson for this publication, intending to collect examples from other teachers interested in agile education. We didn’t get submissions like we hoped for, so the project rested forgotten somewhere in the back of Google drive.  Almost forgotten. We reopened the folder and dusted off the files. This time we’re pursuing this project more, well, agiley. We’re contributing the first vignettes and posting them our research center’s website, www.las.ch/laser. And we’re inviting you, a teacher interested in agility, who is perhaps experimenting with kanban, scrum, or an agile mindset, to share your experiences in the same format. And then we’ll iterate.  Overview of Agile in Education One of the earliest to apply agility in school, John Miller (Agile Classrooms) began experimenting with scrum in 2009. In 2011, Steve Peha shared a presentation at Yahoo called Agile Schools - How Technology Saves Education (Peha, 2011). In the presentation he correctly pointed out how initiatives like No Child Left Behind have failed in the US, and how agility, applied to education, may be a much more productive route.\nIn 2012, Willy Wijnands of Ashram College in the Netherlands, along with his colleagues, began translating scrum into eduScrum. Jeff Sutherland, co-creator of scrum and proponent for its application beyond the software world, referenced eduScrum in his book, Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time.\nIt’s Sutherland’s mention of eduScrum that brought us in contact with both John Miller and Willy Wijnands in October 2014. Since that time both John and Willy have been on our campus more than once and we have, on separate occasions, visited Willy at Ashram College in December 2018 and June 2019. During those years, from 2014 until now, we’ve experimented with scrum, kanban, an agile toolkit for teachers, and agility in general in middle school, high school, and university classes, as well as in faculty meetings and for long term projects like curriculum review and school accreditation. We’ve also trained and published about agility.\nWriting and talking about agility in education is rewarding, if only because it feels so right. Over time, though, we realized that we could share and teach better if we had a collection of solid examples of what you might call agility in education. Perhaps because our own focus was largely on the agile mindset, and not a fixed process, explaining exactly what we meant when we said agile this, agile that, wasn’t always easy. We also may have felt a bit uncomfortable in our own clothes at some points when colleagues mentioned that “they did agile” or when agility was mistaken simply for flexibility, and so on.\nAt any rate, we determined that a set of short examples from a variety of contexts would support the conversation around agility very well. We created a few prototypes in Summer 2016, following some promising applications in a graduate class, and then asked others to share their examples.\nThe additional examples didn’t come and instead of scaling down the project, which would have led to its completion, at least in an MVP type of way, we let the project drop. Beware the big plan! Luckily, our involvement in a push by the Scrum Alliance in Fall 2019 to create a specific certification for educators (the Agile Certified Educator) rekindled our interest, and now, with the proper scope for a first iteration, we are underway again.\nHere is our first iteration of classroom, schoolwide, and organizational applications of the agile mindset, following a simple template, to share the agile mindset. The template suggests which agile concepts you might find in each vignette, and which of the 10 practices of EDgility (Magnuson, Tihen, Cosgrove and Patton, 2019), our own attempt at describing an agile mindset in education, are illustrated.\nIf you are interested in contributing lessons to this collection, please see the template in the appendix and write to us at pmagnuson@las.ch and ncosgrove@las.ch.\nReferences Peha, S.

This was their process:\n Students updated their personal kanban boards. It was easy to see at a glance that all students now had some sections of their paper in the “Ready for peer review” column. We agreed on a time-box of forty minutes. Students and the instructor, as peer reviewers, selected a section (a sticky note, which they initialed) to critique. When a review of a particular section was finished, the reviewer moved the sticky note to the “Just reviewed” column and chose a new section, either from the same or a different scrum board. Nearly all sections had been critiqued and reviewed when the time-box expired. Using a thumbs up, thumbs down (Roman) vote, students either decided to finish the remaining few sections or leave them for the evening outside of class time. On Thursday, students reset their kanban boards, according to their progress from the evening before, and we redid the process.

They enjoyed making the plans for each lesson, which led me to introduce an end-of-lesson planning sheet. After each class, we left five minutes for planning time, which meant that students could suggest what they wanted to work on next class, based on what they had actually completed. When necessary, students made decisions regarding who would lead on certain activities. This was then noted on our sheet and posted on the kanban board.\nThe end-of-lesson planning sheet consisted of the following columns:\n| Date/Lesson | What will we work on next class? | Who will lead/what will we need | | Lesson 3 | - Warm-up | - Student A | | | - Shot practice | - Teacher | | | - Film shots | - We need our phones | | | - Start tournament | - Student B |\n Students were able to use the end-of-lesson planning sheet to help remind themselves, when they entered the class, what had to be set-up or ready to go. If the teacher or a student was absent, work could be easily seen and tracked by anyone on their return. Students had ownership of what they learned, how they learned it, and in what order. Collaboration with the teacher allowed for changes in the curriculum, and the time spent and the depth of activities were appropriate for the students. The sheet provided exactly what had been worked on, which served as a curriculum map for the teacher, as well as a visible learning journey for the students.

Generally half of the students presented, like at a conference poster session, while the other half of the students moved from presentation to presentation. Faculty, the children of faculty members, and the parents of students (if they were visiting the boarding school) were invited as well.\nThe emphasis on demonstrations for summative assessment also influenced assessment in individual classes, particularly the more creative, exploratory subjects. Thus, in 3D Nautical Design, as described in a different vignette, used a Shark Tank style presentation, while a class like Escape Room Design brought participants directly into their projects. Art classes, and other classes with projects (including English, Reading \u0026amp; Writing Workshop, DIY Language, and the Ideal School) also incorporated student demonstrations and sharing as summative events.\nSimilarly, since 2016 we have hosted an annual student conference with poster and breakout sessions. The conference has grown each year, from its original science focus, with internal participants only, to a whole school focus with a number of invitees from other schools. Central to the conference is the creation of a venue for students to share their work with their peers, across schools, and adults.\nWhile we’ve had some success with more formal feedback during these types of public student sharing, we suspect that simply creating an environment where student work is public, and where students need to stand next to their work and explain what they have done, has a washback effect for how they approach their work in the first place. Feedback is nicely distributed over a number of individuals, all of different experiences and age ranges, all with different perspectives.\nSource From Leysin American School, since 2016 if not earlier Questions: Paul Magnuson, pmagnuson@las.ch\nFurther Resources  Globe Day at LAS\n","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"b4a70de65aa2972d3aae47ddffc1788f","permalink":"/trainings/faculty/60_class_demos/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/trainings/faculty/60_class_demos/","section":"trainings","summary":"Agile Concepts  Review Retrospective Feedback  Peak Learning Practices  Transparency Value Uplift  Learning \u0026amp; Teaching When we developed the LAS middle school before the 2016-2017 school year, we decided early on to change the assessment policy (from traditional A-F to 4-1 based on teacher-set standards) and to share student work instead of requiring final assessments.","tags":null,"title":"Classroom Demos","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Agile Concepts  Self-regulation  Peak Learning Practices  Collaboration Exploration  Learning \u0026amp; Teaching Middle school ‘homeroom’ consisted of 30 minute slots, two times a week.

Students, in groups of three or four, created boat building companies. The final product was to be a small plastic boat that (1) went straight on the water surface when flicked with a finger, (2) carried weight (coins), (3) withstood wind from a fan, and (4) withstood waves when a weight was dropped in the tub of water.\nAccompanying the physical boat was advertising for the company and a group sales pitch (as a final assessment) that was presented with a demonstration of the boat in front of an audience. Audience members played the role of investors, allocating their play money to the company(ies) of their choice.\nIterations: The students were learning to use the 3D printer. To make the project accessible, they were first instructed to make a small box. Once successful, they added a triangular prow. When successful they worked on the hull so it wasn’t simply flat. They then played with more advanced designs. This is one type of iteration, what teachers recognize as scaffolding a task.\nBurndown chart: A second type of iteration came in the form of quick teacher feedback, aided by a burndown chart. As students left class, they showed a chart, on the outside of a folder (with relevant materials, sketches, and handouts inside the folder), to the teachers. This “ticket out” set up a cadence that reminded students each class period that making progress was important, as well as giving everyone a chance to recognize successes and acknowledge obstacles.\nReview: In addition to the daily review (a sprint review of sorts) and the overall “Shark Tank” review as a final gamified assessment of the final products of each boat company, Bill led a retrospective for all students about the six-week learning process. Each student gave and received feedback, sitting in a circle, referencing their ability to collaborate, how they addressed dysfunction, how they accepted ideas from one another, which designs did well, and what they would do next if the class were longer, among other topics.\nSource From a middle school course taught at Leysin American School, 2017.

One of the long term projects was the creation of an iBook, almost half of which was dedicated to student-created activities in language awareness (e.g. are there really dozens of words for snow in languages whose speakers live in snowy areas? Does the unequal representation of male pronouns in a language contribute to making that language’s speakers sexist?). Students researched topics, made videos, created classroom exercises, and in general tried to make interesting classroom activities as if they were linguists and curriculum writers.\nAfter struggling with the course’s organization for several weeks, I joined forces with the IT office and began running the class in two-week sprints, in groups of four or five students, with the eduScrum guide clutched in my fist. Each sprint students selected the outline of a possible language awareness lesson from the backlog (one-pagers with an idea and any details I had thought might be useful). Following a template, they then created the activities for that lesson, for use in unspecified world language classes, for example.\nIn each student group there was one leader, which I called the ScrumMaster at the time. This person was, however, mostly a group leader, who was generally the student I felt I could rely on to ensure that the work on a language awareness activity over two weeks would actually make progress. To some extent these leaders also served as ScrumMasters, helping their groups through short standups and reviews - some aspects of Scrum that are easily visible.\nI imagined that my role of teacher was as a Product Owner. My “customers” were the hypothetical world language teachers who might someday use the language awareness activities in their classes. I was representing their needs in my communication with the ScrumMasters and the review of each group’s work. A summative review - at the end of each sprint - included a presentation of the language awareness activity by the group, to me.\nMy IT colleagues and I spent plenty of time that year trying to tease out the Scrum roles in an educational setting. Was I as teacher really the Product Owner or actually the ScrumMaster? Or a little of both? Or … neither? To what extent were the students ScrumMasters or was that just forcing a new terminology on an existing model of project-based groupwork?\nIn hindsight, five years later now, I feel less insecure than I did that first year. I don’t feel confident that these questions are answered (and I encourage everyone adopting Scrum in a classroom context to consider for themselves what the roles mean, who plays them, and what significance they have). Folks who have been pulling agile into education for quite some time still debate what these roles mean and how they are meaningfully applied.\nIt’s the conversation that drives the thinking forward, perhaps. So … what is the role of a product owner in Scrum used in school? A ScrumMaster? How is it the same and different than in contexts outside of school?\nSource From a high school course introducing linguistics at Leysin American School, 2014-2015 Questions: Paul Magnuson, pmagnuson@las.ch, Twitter: @zebmagnuson\nFurther Resources  Delhij, A., van Solingen, R. \u0026amp; Wijnands, W.
