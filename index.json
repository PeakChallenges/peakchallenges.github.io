Drawing on early presentations of agility, particularly the Agile Manifesto, we thought that if educators were aware of certain thinking associated with agility, they could, when given the choice, do a little more of this over that. For example, when presented with the opportunity to structure work, aim for a collaborative instead of go-it-alone mindset; when creating class rituals, aim for a bit more trust than control, and so on.\nBelow is the core, as we conceptualized it in 2019, and the ten practices.

Some examples read like a guide or synopsis of the lesson, some of them are first and foremost a reflection about agile principles that are supported by a classroom activity or unit.\nAuthors: Paul Magnuson, Nicola Cosgrove\nIntroduction  We’ve been talking about and experimenting with agile in education since 2014-2015. In Summer 2016 we wrote the first sample lesson for this publication, intending to collect examples from other teachers interested in agile education. We didn’t get submissions like we hoped for, so the project rested forgotten somewhere in the back of Google drive.  Almost forgotten. We reopened the folder and dusted off the files. This time we’re pursuing this project more, well, agiley. We’re contributing the first vignettes and posting them our research center’s website, www.las.ch/laser. And we’re inviting you, a teacher interested in agility, who is perhaps experimenting with kanban, scrum, or an agile mindset, to share your experiences in the same format. And then we’ll iterate.  Overview of Agile in Education One of the earliest to apply agility in school, John Miller (Agile Classrooms) began experimenting with scrum in 2009. In 2011, Steve Peha shared a presentation at Yahoo called Agile Schools - How Technology Saves Education (Peha, 2011). In the presentation he correctly pointed out how initiatives like No Child Left Behind have failed in the US, and how agility, applied to education, may be a much more productive route.\nIn 2012, Willy Wijnands of Ashram College in the Netherlands, along with his colleagues, began translating scrum into eduScrum. Jeff Sutherland, co-creator of scrum and proponent for its application beyond the software world, referenced eduScrum in his book, Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time.\nIt’s Sutherland’s mention of eduScrum that brought us in contact with both John Miller and Willy Wijnands in October 2014. Since that time both John and Willy have been on our campus more than once and we have, on separate occasions, visited Willy at Ashram College in December 2018 and June 2019. During those years, from 2014 until now, we’ve experimented with scrum, kanban, an agile toolkit for teachers, and agility in general in middle school, high school, and university classes, as well as in faculty meetings and for long term projects like curriculum review and school accreditation. We’ve also trained and published about agility.\nWriting and talking about agility in education is rewarding, if only because it feels so right. Over time, though, we realized that we could share and teach better if we had a collection of solid examples of what you might call agility in education. Perhaps because our own focus was largely on the agile mindset, and not a fixed process, explaining exactly what we meant when we said agile this, agile that, wasn’t always easy. We also may have felt a bit uncomfortable in our own clothes at some points when colleagues mentioned that “they did agile” or when agility was mistaken simply for flexibility, and so on.\nAt any rate, we determined that a set of short examples from a variety of contexts would support the conversation around agility very well. We created a few prototypes in Summer 2016, following some promising applications in a graduate class, and then asked others to share their examples.\nThe additional examples didn’t come and instead of scaling down the project, which would have led to its completion, at least in an MVP type of way, we let the project drop. Beware the big plan! Luckily, our involvement in a push by the Scrum Alliance in Fall 2019 to create a specific certification for educators (the Agile Certified Educator) rekindled our interest, and now, with the proper scope for a first iteration, we are underway again.\nHere is our first iteration of classroom, schoolwide, and organizational applications of the agile mindset, following a simple template, to share the agile mindset. The template suggests which agile concepts you might find in each vignette, and which of the 10 practices of EDgility (Magnuson, Tihen, Cosgrove and Patton, 2019), our own attempt at describing an agile mindset in education, are illustrated.\nIf you are interested in contributing lessons to this collection, please see the template in the appendix and write to us at pmagnuson@las.ch and ncosgrove@las.ch.\nReferences Peha, S.

They enjoyed making the plans for each lesson, which led me to introduce an end-of-lesson planning sheet. After each class, we left five minutes for planning time, which meant that students could suggest what they wanted to work on next class, based on what they had actually completed. When necessary, students made decisions regarding who would lead on certain activities. This was then noted on our sheet and posted on the kanban board.\nThe end-of-lesson planning sheet consisted of the following columns:\n| Date/Lesson | What will we work on next class? | Who will lead/what will we need | | Lesson 3 | - Warm-up | - Student A | | | - Shot practice | - Teacher | | | - Film shots | - We need our phones | | | - Start tournament | - Student B |   Students were able to use the end-of-lesson planning sheet to help remind themselves, when they entered the class, what had to be set-up or ready to go. If the teacher or a student was absent, work could be easily seen and tracked by anyone on their return. Students had ownership of what they learned, how they learned it, and in what order. Collaboration with the teacher allowed for changes in the curriculum, and the time spent and the depth of activities were appropriate for the students. The sheet provided exactly what had been worked on, which served as a curriculum map for the teacher, as well as a visible learning journey for the students.

Students, in groups of three or four, created boat building companies. The final product was to be a small plastic boat that (1) went straight on the water surface when flicked with a finger, (2) carried weight (coins), (3) withstood wind from a fan, and (4) withstood waves when a weight was dropped in the tub of water.\nAccompanying the physical boat was advertising for the company and a group sales pitch (as a final assessment) that was presented with a demonstration of the boat in front of an audience. Audience members played the role of investors, allocating their play money to the company(ies) of their choice.\nIterations: The students were learning to use the 3D printer. To make the project accessible, they were first instructed to make a small box. Once successful, they added a triangular prow. When successful they worked on the hull so it wasn’t simply flat. They then played with more advanced designs. This is one type of iteration, what teachers recognize as scaffolding a task.\nBurndown chart: A second type of iteration came in the form of quick teacher feedback, aided by a burndown chart. As students left class, they showed a chart, on the outside of a folder (with relevant materials, sketches, and handouts inside the folder), to the teachers. This “ticket out” set up a cadence that reminded students each class period that making progress was important, as well as giving everyone a chance to recognize successes and acknowledge obstacles.\nReview: In addition to the daily review (a sprint review of sorts) and the overall “Shark Tank” review as a final gamified assessment of the final products of each boat company, Bill led a retrospective for all students about the six-week learning process. Each student gave and received feedback, sitting in a circle, referencing their ability to collaborate, how they addressed dysfunction, how they accepted ideas from one another, which designs did well, and what they would do next if the class were longer, among other topics.\nSource From a middle school course taught at Leysin American School, 2017.

Generally half of the students presented, like at a conference poster session, while the other half of the students moved from presentation to presentation. Faculty, the children of faculty members, and the parents of students (if they were visiting the boarding school) were invited as well.\nThe emphasis on demonstrations for summative assessment also influenced assessment in individual classes, particularly the more creative, exploratory subjects. Thus, in 3D Nautical Design, as described in a different vignette, used a Shark Tank style presentation, while a class like Escape Room Design brought participants directly into their projects. Art classes, and other classes with projects (including English, Reading \u0026amp; Writing Workshop, DIY Language, and the Ideal School) also incorporated student demonstrations and sharing as summative events.\nSimilarly, since 2016 we have hosted an annual student conference with poster and breakout sessions. The conference has grown each year, from its original science focus, with internal participants only, to a whole school focus with a number of invitees from other schools. Central to the conference is the creation of a venue for students to share their work with their peers, across schools, and adults.\nWhile we’ve had some success with more formal feedback during these types of public student sharing, we suspect that simply creating an environment where student work is public, and where students need to stand next to their work and explain what they have done, has a washback effect for how they approach their work in the first place.

One of the long term projects was the creation of an iBook, almost half of which was dedicated to student-created activities in language awareness (e.g. are there really dozens of words for snow in languages whose speakers live in snowy areas? Does the unequal representation of male pronouns in a language contribute to making that language’s speakers sexist?). Students researched topics, made videos, created classroom exercises, and in general tried to make interesting classroom activities as if they were linguists and curriculum writers.\nAfter struggling with the course’s organization for several weeks, I joined forces with the IT office and began running the class in two-week sprints, in groups of four or five students, with the eduScrum guide clutched in my fist. Each sprint students selected the outline of a possible language awareness lesson from the backlog (one-pagers with an idea and any details I had thought might be useful). Following a template, they then created the activities for that lesson, for use in unspecified world language classes, for example.\nIn each student group there was one leader, which I called the ScrumMaster at the time. This person was, however, mostly a group leader, who was generally the student I felt I could rely on to ensure that the work on a language awareness activity over two weeks would actually make progress. To some extent these leaders also served as ScrumMasters, helping their groups through short standups and reviews - some aspects of Scrum that are easily visible.\nI imagined that my role of teacher was as a Product Owner. My “customers” were the hypothetical world language teachers who might someday use the language awareness activities in their classes. I was representing their needs in my communication with the ScrumMasters and the review of each group’s work. A summative review - at the end of each sprint - included a presentation of the language awareness activity by the group, to me.\nMy IT colleagues and I spent plenty of time that year trying to tease out the Scrum roles in an educational setting. Was I as teacher really the Product Owner or actually the ScrumMaster? Or a little of both? Or … neither? To what extent were the students ScrumMasters or was that just forcing a new terminology on an existing model of project-based groupwork?\nIn hindsight, five years later now, I feel less insecure than I did that first year. I don’t feel confident that these questions are answered (and I encourage everyone adopting Scrum in a classroom context to consider for themselves what the roles mean, who plays them, and what significance they have). Folks who have been pulling agile into education for quite some time still debate what these roles mean and how they are meaningfully applied.\nIt’s the conversation that drives the thinking forward, perhaps. So … what is the role of a product owner in Scrum used in school? A ScrumMaster? How is it the same and different than in contexts outside of school?\nSource From a high school course introducing linguistics at Leysin American School, 2014-2015 Questions: Paul Magnuson, pmagnuson@las.ch, Twitter: @zebmagnuson\nFurther Resources  Delhij, A., van Solingen, R. \u0026amp; Wijnands, W.

It took some time to research and really find out what Agile means, but what really struck me is that there were not many resources available for schools. Here began the birth of an ‘Agile Toolkit.’ The aim of the toolkit was to give teachers what they needed to start implementing Agile practices into their classes. Over two years, the delivery and tools have been built upon and updated, working in an Agile way of course! Amidst this development, a handful of teachers were involved in an initial implementation using a book of resources. After some trial and error and iterative phases, it was decided that teachers who wanted to try Agile in their class would start right away with a visit to their lessons. From there, discussions would begin to help the teacher input Agile in a way that suited their students and their lessons.\nFast forward to today, and there are resources developed to show how Agile can fit into classes, a website, blog and twitter handle for ways to connect all things Agile.

This allows students to learn at their own pace, and frees teachers to provide targeted individual and small-group support in class. This also allows students to continue learning outside of class. Self-Paced Structures: Teachers design self-paced classroom structures, which allow students to control their own learning while meeting essential learning objectives and deadlines. Self-pacing helps students develop important study skills, while allowing for authentic collaboration between students. Mastery-Based Grading: Teachers create “mastery checks” for each lesson, which give students credit only once they’ve demonstrated full understanding of content and skills.

This is easily demonstrated with a kanban board, where you only pull a new task into the TO DO column when you have cleared out the previous task in the TO DO column.\n“My friend and mentor Bill Tihen liked to tell a story of his boss rushing into the office with a new project that was ‘top priority.’ Bill walked him to the Kanban board and said, ‘OK. Which of these other tasks in the TO DO or DOING column should I take off the board?’ ‘No, no,’ the boss exclaimed, ‘those are all top priority, too.’ ‘But that doesn’t work,” Bill answered, pointing at the board. ‘There’s a limit to what we can work on at one time. You’ll have to choose the top top-priority’” (Magnuson, 2020).  Bill got me going with Kanban, and Scrum Boards (or “flaps,” in eduScrum terminology). We experimented with different columns, different lanes, using color-coded stickies, trying matrices to support prioritization. Before long another colleague in IT introduced us to the online version using Trello, which more or less proved itself over time, popping up in the admissions and student life offices, in residence halls, classes, and for organization of large-scale projects like reworking the school’s assessment policy and re-accreditation.\nWhile the features of Trello are excellent, the simple, tactile use of a physical space with sticky notes is highly effective, both for personal and group use. More than one of our visiting scholars (e.g. most recently Adrian Fritschi) has commented on how surprising it is to see so much pen and paper work displayed in a wealthy boarding school that provides laptops and phones to every student. That, in addition to its adoption in several different areas of the school, speaks to the usefulness of a Kanban board.\nWe hope, of course, that the quick visualization also supports transparency, good management of work in progress, a brake on the temptation to multitask, and a more agile mindset.\nSource From LAS, Leysin, Switzerland, starting in 2014 and earlier in the IT office Questions: Paul Magnuson, pmagnuson@las.ch, Twitter: @zebmagnuson\nFurther Resources Magnuson, P.

Sometimes we were implementing a plan and sometimes we stumbled into new practices quite by accident. One of these was teacherless observations.\nOne morning, my colleague DeLona Allers was away from school and I was subbing her class. Before we started I asked the students about the Kanban board at the back of the room. This particular board had the basic categories of To Do, Doing, and Done. There were several flat magnets on which were written the classroom tasks that tended to repeat each week. In fact, they were some of the same ones I had on the agenda from DeLona, in addition to the day’s lesson.\nOn a whim I told the students that I would simply project the substitute plan for the day on the wall and that they should run their usual class, just without Ms. Allers. I decided to take running notes, minute by minute, of what I saw.\nYou’ve guessed the ending already: the students ran the class, some showing even a little pride that they knew what each next step was. A few students veered of course or had stretches of inattention. Nothing new there. Sometimes their peers helped them get back on track. That seemed promising. At the end of the lesson I shared the notes via Google Classroom with DeLona and thanked the students. The teacherless observation was born.\nLater in the year Nic and I wrote up another teacherless observation. This time it was about one of Nic’s middle school Physical Education classes. I observed for nearly 90 minutes as students set up the gym, warmed up, taught a lesson, practiced, rearranged themselves into teams, and ran a badminton tournament. And they cleaned up at the end before heading to the locker rooms. At that point I shared my running notes and packed my bag. On the way out of the gymnasium I ran into Nic, who was coming in for her next class. “How was my observation?” she asked. “Great!” I replied.\nHow do teacherless observations fit the agile mindset? We think first and foremost that agile without trust is hardly agile. There isn’t much self-regulation if you can’t trust your students (and to extrapolate, our staff, your colleagues, your spouse, your children). Trust has got to be one of the cornerstones of an agile mindset. And in this case, the teacher has to trust the students to run the lesson, and the observer to simply observe - and the observer has to trust that the lesson will work (lest the observer becomes an unprepared substitute teacher)!\nThe other piece of agility here is of course student agency. You have to let them practice it if you claim you are teaching it.\nYou can read more about this particular lesson and the benefits of teacherless observations in a chapter that Nic and two of our colleagues co-authored, Getting Agile at School.\nSource From the LAS middle school, Leysin, Switzerland, 2017-2018 Questions: Paul Magnuson, pmagnuson@las.ch, Twitter: @zebmagnuson\nFurther Resources Magnuson, P.

As Peter Gray put it, “we are putting more responsibility on our children or you could say we’re giving our children more freedom, but those things are two sides of the same coin. Freedom requires responsibility” (Gray, 2020).\nIn other words, without freedom, how are students going to practice responsibility?\nWe’ve experimented, as we’ve worked with the agile mindset, in two related programs - related in that the first program, the progressive middle school, was an early iteration of the second program, called LAS edge.\nMiddle School (grades 7 and 8). While we tried to release responsibility (and therefore give freedom) in general, two areas stand out, Homeroom (see Homeroom elsewhere in this publication and Project Innovate.\nProject Innovate was a 5-week class during which students chose a focus and worked on it. Though we initially tried to write a curriculum with more detail than that, in the end the curriculum was, more or less, “do stuff!” With that freedom came responsibility, or the opportunity to learn responsibility, which some students did of course better than others. We teachers often said to each other that we had to trust that what we were doing was good for the children - even if not terribly visible at the moment.\nLAS edge (grades 8, 9 and 10). Building on the middle school experience - both its successes and its return over time to a much more traditional school philosophy, we built a new curriculum for older students in several disciplines (e.g entrepreneurship, STEAM, the arts) which focused on skills first and content second. Another way to express this is that the content of the disciplines was necessary in order to practice skills of self-regulation. We trained with agile games, encouraged pull systems, autonomy, and pursuing individual interests. Student feedback during the second semester consistently mentioned feeling lost at first, struggling with the notion that “the teacher wasn’t going to help you” and that “the teacher lets you do anything.” While both sentiments are expressed in stark teenage terms, this is basically correct. For one of their eight class obligations, at least, students had to learn how to identify an interest and pursue it. In this way LAS edge is similar to Project Innovate in the earlier grades.\nSource From programs created by LAS Educational Research, Leysin American School, staring in 2016 Questions: Paul Magnuson, pmagnuson@las.ch, Twitter: @zebmagnuson\nFurther Resources  Gray, P.

Cultivating a sense of adventure is similar to encouraging an atmosphere of playfulness and joy of learning. This can be quite straightforward when students are allowed to create their own goals and their own context for the goals within the curriculum. Of course, any good adventure can’t be too easy. It’s the teacher’s job to make sure a project has no obvious, googleable answer.\nWe might worry that making the project hard and beyond what the students know how to do could be unfair or even unjust. This might be true. When students are used to the mindset of getting things right the first time, it is difficult for them to take an idea and ‘play’ with it until something works. This adjustment takes some time, but once they get the hang of it, students enjoy exploring and they learn quickly.\nPersonally, I most enjoy observing how students learn resilience through ‘playing’ with ideas and trying different options until they find a solution. In fact, in today’s world it may be more important to learn resilience, persistence, and finding the next small workable step in order to progress toward a goal.\nOf course creating an environment where exploration can thrive requires not doing a few things, too - such as:\n Not judging or criticizing mistakes or rework Not judging the work or its qualities, instead let the kids cultivate their own pride and ownership (the minimum quality tests need clear, objective and observable) Not celebrating the answers, but celebrating the exploratory and learning aspects. Not requiring that every student have the same depth of knowledge in each part of the project. It\u0026rsquo;s important to define baseline knowledge they all need to have - but after that they need to be free to explore more deeply what the student finds interesting.  To encourage exploration we have found that the following the guidance for a growth mindset is very helpful:\n Praise the grit and perseverance of arriving at a workable solution; Cultivate the mindset of finding the next workable thing to try, even when there is no clear path to the goal; and Encourage / expect (maybe even require) rework and changes.  On a practical note, it is important to create projects that are complex and have some built-in conflict that requires balancing and tradeoffs. This is important for several reasons:\n Without trade-offs, a problem isn’t realistic and can be too easily googled. The problem must be challenging enough or it isn’t engaging (but it needs to be workable). Having to resolve a conflict or resolve tradeoffs and still arrive at one\u0026rsquo;s goals requires students to really go into depth and learn that aspect extra well.   NOTE: In the world of engineering, it is important to have a solid generalist understanding of the field (like the basic required information tested at school), but that is rarely enough for most teams. It is important to be a specialist in at least one area of interest \u0026ndash; these are called ‘T’ shaped engineers - engineers that have gone deep into two areas are even more valuable and are called ‘π’ shaped engineers. I’m advocating for creating projects (and classroom environments) in school that cultivate the same generalist / specialist mindset that is often expected in graduate school and professional lives. Art curriculums have long taught the core skills and ideas and then expected students to explore and expand upon their interests. Imagine how engaging education could be when all aspects of schools encouraged choice and exploration.\n Teaching this way can be uncomfortable for teachers who may traditionally have felt that they need to operate as the expert who knows everything. To model the idea, however, that you don’t have to know everything, it is actually helpful not to know everything. In fact, you cannot give students a quick answer, which cuts off their chance to think through the problem, and instead you explore with the students and model how to learn and resolve difficult problems. The teacher must simply understand the basics and vocabulary of the field to help students interpret what they find. Of course the teacher must also be comfortable modeling exploring the unknown with the kids.\n","date":1591023436,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591196236,"objectID":"c0f88927a9a34594e57398343c1db63d","permalink":"/blog/edgility_classroom_exploration/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T16:57:16+02:00","relpermalink":"/blog/edgility_classroom_exploration/","section":"blog","summary":"When students are trusted to explore and know that mistakes are ok, learning becomes fun and engaging.

Drawing on early presentations of agility, particularly the Agile Manifesto, we thought that if educators were aware of certain thinking associated with agility, they could, when given the choice, do a little more of this over that. For example, when presented with the opportunity to structure work, aim for a collaborative instead of go-it-alone mindset; when creating class rituals, aim for a bit more trust than control, and so on.\nBelow is the core, as we conceptualized it in 2019, and the ten practices. Note that even in the article we suggest we may have missed some key practices. But we think these do a fairly good job of getting one started in a fresh mindset about education.\nValues These are our values, the core of the mindset we’re working toward:\n EXPLORATION - Exploration and play over tests and perfection; GROWTH - Growth and rework over assessment reports without corresponding mechanisms to improve identified weaknesses; SELF-REGULATION - Student-driven reflection and improvement over teacher directives; and LIFE WORTHY LEARNING - Learning that supports additional learning over detailed course content.  Preferences  EXPLORATION - Exploration over fixed content GROWTH MINDSET - Growth over stasis TRUST - Self-regulation over teacher control TRANSPARENCY - Visibility over obscurity ADAPTABILITY - Flexibility over rigidity SMALLIFY - Quick, workable iterations and feedback over big plans VALUE - Valuable learning over convenient assessments COLLABORATION - Working together over competing against REDO - Reflection and progress over right and done UPLIFT - Problems as opportunity over problems as problems  Examples of each of these practices can be found in ​EDgility: Pulling Agile in Education currently in review for the book Agile Education, Lean Learning.\nProfessional Learning EDgility Professional Learning invites teachers to choose two of the practices in a largely self-directed process and follow the below instructions:\n Select one ​EDgility practice that was successful in the past few weeks. Select one ​EDgility practice that was difficult in the past few weeks. As a reminder, put these in a visible place before and during lessons. Notice how the two practices are going during the teaching day. After several days, or when the time is right, write a short vignette about a time in class when each ​EDgility practice was working well. Save the writing in the ​EDgility Pro Learning folder​.
